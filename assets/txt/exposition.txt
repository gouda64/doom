You, an intrepid student, have been thrown into the
sketchy depths of the HCS2 classroom. In this barren
gray landscape accented only by the red of blo-love
for Java, armed with the items of your fallen
comrades, can you survive?

Red marks the exit! The monsters hurt you - if your
health gets to 0, you get sent back to HCS1.
Walk into items to pick them up. Potions heal 2
health, ammo give 10 ammo, and
chestplates give 10 armor.
Weapons are added to your inventory (you can get
the pencil, fire flower, and bubble wand).
Later weapons do more damage, and the equipped
inventory slot will be white when the weapon
is ready to fire.
